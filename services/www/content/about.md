---

Hello! My name is **Serge Gatezh**, and I'm a Front-end Engineer based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

I specialize in building modern web applications with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **JavaScript**. My day-to-day work revolves around crafting performant, accessible user interfaces and improving developer experience across the stack.

Beyond front-end development, I enjoy exploring topics like **DevOps**, **Docker**, **Cloudflare Workers**, **GraphQL**, and security practices such as hardware-backed SSH keys with the macOS Secure Enclave. I write about these subjects on this blog to share what I learn along the way.

I'm an active contributor on [GitHub](https://github.com/gatezh), where I maintain open source projects including [hugo-tailwindcss-starter](https://github.com/gatezh/hugo-tailwindcss-starter) (a Hugo starter theme with Tailwind CSS) and [devcontainer-bun-template](https://github.com/gatezh/devcontainer-bun-template) (a dev container template for Bun projects).

You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/gatezh). I hold TN visa eligibility and am open to opportunities in the United States.
